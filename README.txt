A very simple Bukkit plugin that lets you take apart items based on the recipies given in dismantle.cfg

To install, put the Dismantle.jar file in the plugins folder, as well as the dismantle.cfg file (a default is provided here)

For the players to use, they will need the 'dismantle.use' permission. Then just use '/dismantle' while holding the item to take apart.

To add recipies to the config, follow this format:
<ITEM_TO_TAKE_APART_NAME>
<PART_1> <QTY>
<PART_2> <QTY>
...
<PART_N> <QTY>

There must be at least one blank line before the next recipie starts.
